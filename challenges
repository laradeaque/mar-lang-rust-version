I had issue with consistency. I believe its due to the project complexity.

Many fights with the compiler due to a function called evaluate_expression 
which wanted to return different types, which were not clear at compile time
but I managed to work around it differrently.

Main reason for lazy expression i.e Unless we want pass sth as an argument we 
dont need to get result of the expression, since who knows it may never be used.
and why waste compute power computing.
